# Classification vs Regression

Classification and regression are two broad categories of supervised learning problems in machine learning.

In a **classification problem**, the goal is to predict a categorical label or class for an input example. The input example can be any kind of data, such as images, text, or numerical data. Examples of classification problems include image classification (identifying what an image contains), text classification (determining the topic or sentiment of a document), and spam detection (identifying whether an email is spam or not). In classification problems, the output is a discrete or categorical variable.

In contrast, **regression problems** are concerned with predicting a continuous numerical value based on an input example. The input example can again be any kind of data, such as images, text, or numerical data. Examples of regression problems include predicting the price of a house given its features, predicting the temperature for a given day, and predicting the length of a movie based on its plot summary. In regression problems, the output is a continuous variable.

The main difference between classification and regression is the nature of the output variable. 

- In classification problems, the output is categorical e.g. colors `["red", "green", "blue"]`
- In regression problems, the output is continuous e.g. shoe size `[14, 12, 4, 5, 6]`

As a result, different machine learning algorithms and techniques are used to solve these two types of problems. For example, decision trees and random forests are popular for classification problems, while linear regression, neural networks, and support vector regression are popular for regression problems.

It is important to note that the choice between classification and regression depends on the nature of the problem and the type of data available. For example, if the target variable is a categorical variable, then a classification algorithm must be used. If the target variable is a continuous variable, then a regression algorithm must be used. In some cases, it may be possible to transform a classification problem into a regression problem or vice versa, depending on the specifics of the problem
