## Step 1: Save Your Script

Save your Python script with a .py file extension, for example, script.py. Place the script in the appropriate directory within your project.

## Step 2: Open a Terminal or Command Prompt

Open a terminal (Linux and macOS) or command prompt (Windows) on your computer.

## Step 3: Navigate to the Script Directory

In the terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where your Python script is located using the cd command. For example:

```bash

cd path/to/your/python_script_directory
```

Replace path/to/your/python_script_directory with the correct path to the folder containing your Python script.

## Step 4: Activate Virtual Environment (Optional)

If you have set up a virtual environment for your project, activate it before running your script:

### On Windows

```bash
your_venv_name\Scripts\activate
```

### On macOS and Linux

```bash
source your_venv_name/bin/activate
```

Replace your_venv_name with the name of your virtual environment.

## Step 5: Run Your Python Script

### Remember, you should be "inside" your virtual env when trying to run your code. This means you have used the "activate" script

Run your Python script by entering the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
python script.py
```

Replace script.py with the name of your Python script.

The script will now execute, and you will see the output in your terminal or command prompt. If your script has any errors, you will see the error messages, which will help you debug and fix the issues.
