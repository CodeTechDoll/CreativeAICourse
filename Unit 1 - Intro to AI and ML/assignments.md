## 1.2 Supervised and Unsupervised Learning: Micro Assignment

**Objective:** Apply supervised and unsupervised learning techniques to real-world problems using a dataset of your choice.

**Assignment Instructions:**

1. Choose a dataset relevant to your interests or field of study. Some popular sources for datasets include [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets), [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php), and [Google Dataset Search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/).

2. Apply a supervised learning algorithm (e.g., linear regression, logistic regression, or decision trees) to your dataset. Evaluate the performance of your model using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, F1 score, or mean squared error).

3. Apply an unsupervised learning algorithm (e.g., k-means clustering or principal component analysis) to your dataset. Interpret the results and discuss their relevance to the problem you are trying to solve.

**Learning Objectives:**

- Apply supervised and unsupervised learning techniques to real-world problems
- Evaluate the performance of supervised learning models using appropriate metrics
- Interpret the results of unsupervised learning algorithms and discuss their relevance to the problem at hand
