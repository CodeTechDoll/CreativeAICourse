# Unit 1: Final Project

The final project for Unit 1 is designed to test your overall understanding of the concepts covered in this unit. You will implement a supervised learning algorithm on a real-world dataset and evaluate its performance. The project will culminate in the creation of a simple report describing your approach, results, and potential improvements.

## Project Instructions

1. Choose a real-world dataset relevant to your interests or field of study. Some popular sources for datasets include [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets), [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php), and [Google Dataset Search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/).

2. Implement a supervised learning algorithm (e.g., linear regression, k-Nearest Neighbors) on the chosen dataset using existing libraries, such as [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/), [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), or [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/). 

3. Evaluate the performance of your model using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, F1 score, or mean squared error). 

4. Write a simple report (2-3 pages) describing your work. The report should include the following sections:
   - **Introduction:** An overview of the problem you are trying to solve and its relevance. Provide some context and background information about the chosen dataset and its features.
   - **Methodology:** A description of the supervised learning algorithm you implemented, including any preprocessing steps, model parameters, and training/validation strategies.
   - **Results:** An analysis of the performance of your model, including quantitative evaluations (e.g., accuracy, F1 score, or mean squared error) and any relevant visualizations (e.g., confusion matrix, learning curves, or ROC curves).
   - **Discussion:** Interpret the results of your model and discuss any challenges, limitations, or potential improvements. Consider how the choice of algorithm, preprocessing steps, and model parameters might have affected the results.
   - **Conclusion:** Summarize the main points of your project and discuss any future directions for research or improvements.
