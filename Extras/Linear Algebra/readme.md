## Unit 7 Project

### Project Description

Implement a linear regression model from scratch using linear algebra concepts learned throughout the course. The project should include the following steps:

1. Load a real-world dataset suitable for linear regression.
2. Preprocess and explore the dataset.
3. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
4. Implement the linear regression algorithm using matrix operations
5. Train the linear regression model on the training set.
6. Evaluate the model's performance using the testing set.
7. Optimize the model using techniques such as regularization.
8. Interpret the results and discuss the model's performance.
