# Projection and Orthogonal Components (Simplified Explanation)

## Projection

Imagine you have a physical arrow pointing in a particular direction, and you shine a flashlight directly above and down onto the arrow so that it casts a shadow onto another arrow pointing in a different direction.

The shadow on the second arrow is the projection of the first arrow onto the second arrow. In other words, it tells us how much of the first arrow is pointing in the same direction as the second arrow.

## Orthogonal Component

The orthogonal component is the part of the first arrow that is perpendicular (or orthogonal) to the second arrow. It's like the leftover part of the first arrow after you've removed its projection onto the second arrow.

In the flashlight example, the orthogonal component represents the height of the first arrow above the second arrow, or how much of the first arrow is pointing away from the second arrow in a direction perpendicular to the second arrow.

Understanding these concepts is important because they come up frequently in many areas of mathematics and computer science, including AI development.
