## Modify the Secret in AWS Secrets Manager

- Implementation:
  1. Open the AWS Secrets Manager console in the AWS Management Console.
  2. Find the secret you previously created (e.g., "SageMakerGitHubToken").
  3. Click on the secret's name to open its details page.
  4. Click the "Retrieve secret value" button.
  5. Click the "Edit" button next to the "Secret value" field.
  6. Modify the secret's JSON content to include 'username' and 'password' keys. For example, `{"username": "your_github_username", "password": "your_personal_access_token"}` (replace 'your_github_username' with your GitHub username, and 'your_personal_access_token' with the token you generated in the previous steps).
  7. Click the "Save" button.
- Why: SageMaker requires the 'username' and 'password' keys in the secret to authenticate with the GitHub repository.
- Pros: Correctly configures the secret for use with SageMaker.
- Cons: Requires accessing and modifying the secret in AWS Secrets Manager.
