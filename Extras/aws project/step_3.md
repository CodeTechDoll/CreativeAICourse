## Step 3: Use Amazon SageMaker

### Step 3.1: Create a SageMaker instance

- Core concept: Amazon SageMaker instance is a managed environment for running Jupyter notebooks.
- Implementation:
  1. Navigate to the Amazon SageMaker service in the AWS Management Console.
  2. Click on "Notebook instances" in the left sidebar.
  3. Click the "Create notebook instance" button.
- Why: Provides a managed environment for building, training, and deploying ML models.
- Pros: Simplifies the setup process and integrates with other AWS services.
- Cons: Can be overwhelming for beginners.

### Step 3.2: Configure the notebook instance

- Core concept: Set up the instance with required settings, such as instance type, IAM role, and optional Git repository.
- Implementation:
  1. Enter a name for the notebook instance.
  2. Choose an instance type (e.g., ml.t2.medium for small-scale projects).
  3. Create or choose an existing IAM role that allows SageMaker to access necessary AWS services (e.g., S3).
  4. Optionally, configure a Git repository to store your code and data.
  5. Click "Create notebook instance."
- Why: Configures the notebook instance to have the necessary resources and permissions.
- Pros: Customizable setup to suit your project's needs.
- Cons: Requires understanding of AWS concepts, such as IAM roles.

### Step 3.3: Open the Jupyter notebook

- Core concept: Jupyter notebooks provide an interactive coding environment for developing and testing ML models.
- Implementation:
  1. Wait for the notebook instance status to change to "InService."
  2. Click "Open Jupyter" or "Open JupyterLab" to launch the notebook interface.
- Why: Jupyter notebooks offer an interactive and visual environment for working with ML models.
- Pros: Supports step-by-step code execution, visualizations, and markdown documentation.
- Cons: May have a learning curve if you're new to Jupyter notebooks.

### Step 3.4: Create a new notebook

- Core concept: Create a new notebook file in the Jupyter interface to start developing your model.
- Implementation:
  1. In the Jupyter interface, click the "New" button and select a kernel (e.g., "conda_python3").
  2. Start writing code in the newly created notebook.
- Why: A new notebook serves as the workspace for building, training, and testing your ML model.
- Pros: Organizes code and documentation in a single file, easy to share and collaborate.
- Cons: Requires familiarity with the Jupyter interface and notebook file management.
