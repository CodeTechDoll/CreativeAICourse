## Step 4: Create a dataset

### 4.1 Collect and organize the stories

#### Core concept

Gather the stories written by you and your friends to use as the training data for the language model.

#### Implementation

- Obtain the stories from various sources (text files, emails, shared documents, etc.).
- Convert each story into a plain text format, removing any unnecessary formatting.
- Organize the stories into a single file, e.g., `stories.txt`.

#### Explanation

Collecting and organizing the stories ensures that the model is trained on a custom dataset tailored to your specific requirements. This will enable the model to learn the style, themes, and vocabulary present in the stories, ultimately helping it generate better responses.

#### Pros

- Custom dataset for better model performance.
- Control over the type and quality of data.

#### Cons

- Manual effort required to collect, organize, and clean the data.
- The need for a large dataset to ensure meaningful training.

### 4.2 Structure the dataset

#### Core concept

Create a structured format, such as CSV or JSON, to represent the collected stories in a way that can be easily processed by the model.

#### Implementation

- Decide on a structure for your dataset, for example:
  - CSV format: "story_id", "story_text"
  - JSON format: `{ "story_id": 1, "story_text": "your_story_here" }`
- Write a script or use a tool to convert the collected stories into the chosen format.
- Save the structured data in a single file, e.g., `stories.csv` or `stories.json`.

#### Explanation

Converting the stories into a structured format makes it easier to preprocess, split, and feed the data into the model. This ensures efficient data handling and reduces the chances of errors during training.

#### Pros

- Easier data management.
- Streamlined preprocessing and training.

#### Cons

- Requires additional effort to convert and structure the data.

### 4.3 Preprocess the dataset

#### Core concept

Clean and preprocess the dataset, ensuring it's in a suitable format for model training.

#### Implementation

- Tokenize the text: Convert the stories into a sequence of tokens (words or subwords, depending on the model's requirements).
- Handle special characters: Remove or replace any special characters that might cause issues during training.
- Truncate/pad sequences: Ensure that all sequences are of the same length. Truncate longer sequences and pad shorter ones with a special padding token (usually denoted as `<pad>`).

#### Explanation

Preprocessing the dataset is necessary to ensure that the model can efficiently learn from the data. Tokenizing, handling special characters, and ensuring consistent sequence lengths are all important steps to prepare the data for training.

#### Math

Tokenization can be performed using various techniques, such as:

- Word-based: Split the text into individual words.
- Subword-based: Split the text into smaller units, such as n-grams or Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) tokens.

#### Pros

- Improved model performance.
- Reduced chances of errors during training.

#### Cons

- Requires additional effort and understanding of preprocessing techniques.
