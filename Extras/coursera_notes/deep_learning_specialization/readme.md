### Course Description

This deep learning course is divided into five parts, each focusing on different aspects of deep learning:

1. **Building and Training Neural Networks:** Learn to build a neural network, including deep neural networks, and train them on data. As a practical example, build a cat recognizer.
2. **Practical Aspects of Deep Learning:** Focus on improving neural network performance through hyperparameter tuning, regularization, diagnosing bias and variance, and advanced optimization algorithms (momentum, RMSprop, and Adam).
3. **Structuring Machine Learning Projects:** Understand the changes in strategy for building machine learning systems in the era of deep learning, such as splitting data into train, development, and test sets, dealing with different data distributions, and implementing end-to-end deep learning.
4. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** Learn about convolutional neural networks and their applications, particularly in image processing.
5. **Sequence Models and Natural Language Processing:** Study sequence models like recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) models, and apply them to natural language processing, speech recognition, and music generation.
