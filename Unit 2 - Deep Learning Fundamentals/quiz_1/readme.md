# Quiz: Neural Network Architecture

- (Theoretical) What is the primary difference between a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)?

- (Theoretical) Explain the purpose of activation functions in neural networks and provide examples of two commonly used activation functions.

- (Coding) Design a simple neural network using Keras for a binary classification problem. The input data has 20 features. Use the Sequential model with a single hidden layer containing 64 neurons and a ReLU activation function. Include an output layer with the appropriate activation function for binary classification.

- (Theoretical) What is the vanishing gradient problem, and how does it affect the training of deep neural networks?

- (Theoretical) Briefly describe the concept of residual connections introduced by the ResNet architecture and explain how they help with training deeper neural networks.
