# train_test_split()

`train_test_split` is a function in scikit-learn that splits a dataset into training and testing subsets. This is a commonly used technique in machine learning to evaluate the performance of a model on new, unseen data.

The `train_test_split` function takes in one or more arrays or matrices of data, along with a test size or train size parameter (expressed as a percentage of the total data), and returns multiple arrays or matrices of data. By default, the function splits the data randomly into training and testing subsets.

In general, its parameters are:

- **arrays**: One or more arrays or matrices of data to be split into train and test sets.
- **test_size**: The proportion of the data to be included in the test set. Can be a float (e.g. 0.2 for 20%) or an integer (e.g. 100 for 100 samples).
- **train_size**: The proportion of the data to be included in the train set. Can be a float or an integer. If both test_size and train_size are specified, test_size takes precedence.
- **random_state**: A seed for the random number generator used to shuffle the data before splitting. Can be an integer or a random number generator object.
- **shuffle**: Whether or not to shuffle the data before splitting. Default is True.
- **stratify**: An optional array of labels for stratified sampling. If specified, the sampling is done in a stratified fashion, preserving the percentage of samples for each class in the train and test sets. If not specified, sampling is done randomly.

Here's an example of how to use train_test_split:

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
import pandas as pd

# load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

# separate the target variable from the features
X = df.drop('target_variable', axis=1)
y = df['target_variable']

# split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

In this example, we load a dataset from a CSV file and separate the target variable from the features. We then use train_test_split to split the data into training and testing sets. The test_size parameter is set to 0.2, which means that 20% of the data will be used for testing and 80% will be used for training. The random_state parameter is set to 42, which ensures that the same random split is generated every time the code is run.

After the split, we have four separate arrays or matrices of data: X_train, X_test, y_train, and y_test. We can use these subsets of data to train a machine learning model on the training data, and then evaluate its performance on the testing data.
