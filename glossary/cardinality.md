# Cardinality

Cardinality refers to the number of unique values or categories within a particular feature or variable in a dataset. In the context of categorical variables, high cardinality means that a feature has a large number of distinct categories, while low cardinality means that there are only a few unique categories.

High cardinality can pose challenges for machine learning models because:

- It can lead to increased memory usage and computational requirements, especially when using methods like one-hot encoding.
- It can result in sparse representations, where most elements are zero, which can negatively affect the performance of some algorithms.
- It might lead to overfitting, as models may learn to rely too heavily on rare categories that only appear in the training set but not in the validation or test set.

To handle high cardinality, you can use techniques such as target encoding, binary encoding, or embeddings, which can represent categories more compactly than one-hot encoding. Additionally, you may consider combining or grouping similar categories to reduce cardinality or using dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA to create a lower-dimensional representation of the data.
