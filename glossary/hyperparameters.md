# Hyperparameters

In machine learning, a model is a mathematical function that maps a set of inputs to a set of outputs. The goal of machine learning is to learn the model parameters from the available data so that it can make accurate predictions on new, unseen data. The model parameters are typically learned using an optimization algorithm that tries to minimize the difference between the predicted outputs and the actual outputs on the training data.

**Hyperparameters** are parameters of the machine learning algorithm that are not learned from the data, but are set before training. They are typically set by the user or by a search algorithm that tries to find the best values for them. The choice of hyperparameters can have a big impact on the performance of the model, and tuning the hyperparameters is often an important part of the machine learning workflow.

Here are some examples of hyperparameters for different machine learning algorithms:

- Naive Bayes: The hyperparameters for Naive Bayes are typically the smoothing parameter, which controls how much weight is given to unseen features, and the type of distribution assumed for the input variables (e.g., Gaussian, multinomial, etc.).
- Neural Networks: The hyperparameters for neural networks include the number of layers, the number of neurons in each layer, the activation function used in each layer, the learning rate, the regularization parameter, and the optimization algorithm used to update the weights.
- K-Nearest Neighbors: The hyperparameters for KNN include the number of nearest neighbors to consider, the distance metric used to measure similarity between data points, and the weighting scheme used to combine the neighbors' outputs.

Tuning the hyperparameters can be done manually by trying different values and observing the performance on a validation set, or it can be automated using techniques such as grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization.

In summary, hyperparameters are parameters of a machine learning algorithm that are set before training and are not learned from the data. They can have a big impact on the performance of the model, and tuning them is often an important part of the machine learning workflow
