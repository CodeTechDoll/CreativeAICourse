# Feature

A **feature** in the context of machine learning is a characteristic or property of an object that can be used as an input for a model to make predictions or decisions. Features are also referred to as attributes, variables, or dimensions. In a dataset, features are usually represented as columns, and each row represents an individual observation or instance.

Scaling and normalizing features refer to the process of transforming the values of features to make them comparable and to improve the performance and convergence of machine learning algorithms. Many algorithms are sensitive to the scale of the input features and may perform poorly if the features have different scales or magnitudes.
