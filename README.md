# AI Development for Creative Applications

**Objective**: This course aims to provide an in-depth understanding of generative AI techniques, and their applications in game development, music generation, and AI-controlled cars. By the end of the course, students should be able to create projects in these areas and teach others how to do the same.

## Course Outline

### 1. Introduction to Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

- AI and ML fundamentals
- Supervised and unsupervised learning
- Reinforcement learning
- Common ML algorithms and their applications

**Homework**: Implement a supervised learning algorithm (e.g., linear regression, k-Nearest Neighbors) on a real-world dataset and evaluate its performance. Write a brief report explaining your approach, results, and potential improvements.

### 2. Deep Learning Fundamentals

- Neural networks and backpropagation
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU)

**Homework**: Build a simple neural network to classify handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. Experiment with different network architectures and document your findings.

### 3. Introduction to Generative Models

- Autoencoders
- Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)
- Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
- Transformer-based models

**Homework**: Train an autoencoder on the CIFAR-10 dataset to compress and reconstruct images. Evaluate the quality of the reconstructed images and discuss the performance of the model.

### 4. AI in Game Development

- Procedural content generation (PCG)
- Level and asset generation using GANs and VAEs
- AI-driven game characters and behaviors
- Reinforcement learning for game agents

**Homework**: Design and implement a procedural content generation system for a simple 2D game level. Use a generative model like a GAN or VAE to create new assets or level layouts. Write a brief report on your methodology and the results.

### 5. AI in Music Generation

- Music representation and processing
- Melody and harmony generation
- RNNs and LSTMs for sequence generation
- Transformer-based models for music generation (e.g., OpenAI's MuseNet)

**Homework**: Train an LSTM or Transformer-based model to generate short MIDI sequences based on a dataset of your choice. Evaluate the generated music for creativity and coherence, and provide a few examples of generated sequences.

### 6. AI for Autonomous Vehicles

- Perception and sensor fusion
- Path planning and decision making
- Control algorithms
- Reinforcement learning for autonomous driving

**Homework**: Simulate a basic path planning algorithm for an autonomous vehicle in a virtual environment. Implement a reactive or model-based method and demonstrate the vehicle's ability to navigate the environment while avoiding obstacles.

### 7. Ethical Considerations and AI Safety

- Bias and fairness
- Transparency and explainability
- Privacy and security
- AI safety techniques

**Homework**: Choose a case study involving an AI system and analyze the ethical implications of its deployment. Discuss potential biases, fairness issues, and possible mitigation strategies in a short essay.

### 8. Project Work

- Students will choose a project in one of the three domains (game development, music generation, or AI-controlled cars) and apply the techniques learned to create a working prototype.

**Homework**: Develop a proposal for your chosen project, including a clear problem
